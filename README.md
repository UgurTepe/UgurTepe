<h4 align="center">I'm an incoming PhD student in string theory at Magdalen College, University of Oxford.</h4>

I recently finished my **master's** (Part III of the Mathematical Tripos) in **applied mathematics** (= mathematical physics) at St John's College, University of Cambridge. Before that I got my **BSc in Physics** from Stockholm University. I'm constantly trying to make sense of symmetries, number theory and strings. I'm not extremely active on my GitHub, but feel free to look around.
